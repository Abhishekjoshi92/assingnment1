What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","- Python is high level, interpreted programming language that is easy to learn and use. It's popular because it's easy to use and easily availabe."],"metadata":{"id":"0xyCPsDQBnDi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","- Interpreter is basically programme that reads and execute python code."],"metadata":{"id":"I86gj8p6CXk7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3.

Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","- Lists are mutable because we can change the order of items in a list or reassign an item in a list. they can be modified or changed after they are created. Tuples are immutable, once they are created, we can't change, add, or remove their elements. If we try to modify a tuple, it will throw a TypeError."],"metadata":{"id":"pFR1wxQkEz70"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in Python?\n","- First of all \"==\" checks if two values are equal and it's a type of comparison operators. on the other hand \"is\" checks if two variables point to the same object in memory."],"metadata":{"id":"LfmzQlIiFR_f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","- Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. example of logical operators are - AND, OR, NOT.\n","AND - True if both statements are true.\n","OR - True if one of the statements is true.\n","NOT - Reverse the result, if the result is true it will return false and viceversa."],"metadata":{"id":"4HkqlOawGTnW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9. What is type casting in Python?\n","- Type casting means changing the data type of a value to another type.\n","example - you can change an integer (5) into a string (\"5\") or string (\"123\") into an integer (123).\n","We do this by using functions like - int(), float(), str() etc."],"metadata":{"id":"FNwCb6gMG-bd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","- Implicit - Python understand the data type.\n","Explicit - Convert data type using inbuilt functions like - int, str, float, bool."],"metadata":{"id":"_G2H4FJGHlFl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","- The purpose of conditionl statements in Python is to make decisions in your code. They let your program choose different actions based on different conditions. instead of running all the code at once, conditional statements allow you to control the flow like - If this happens, do that; something else.\n","In python, the main conditional statements are - if, elif, else."],"metadata":{"id":"k9YYXrN6IBWl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12. How does the elif statement work?\n","- The elif statement in Python means \"else if.\" It's used when you want to check multiple conditions one after another. If the first if condition isn't true, Python moves to the elif and checks that. You can have as many elif parts as you need. It helps keep the code cleaner instead of writing a bunch of separate if statements."],"metadata":{"id":"A0fyqsNyI7ts"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","- A for loop- is used when you know how many times you want to repeat something. For example, if you want to repeat something 5 times, you use a for loop.\n","A while loop- is used when you don't know how many times to repeat. It keeps going until a certain condition is no longer true. So, it's like saying, \"Keep doing this as long as this thing is true."],"metadata":{"id":"Zv2zfdTKJaEJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","- you're building a game where the player keeps guessing a number until they get it right. You don't know how many guesses it will take, so a while loop is perfect. It will keep asking the player for input as long as they haven't guessed the correct number. Once they do, the loop stops.\n","This is the kind of situation where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop, because you don't know how many guesses will be made in advance."],"metadata":{"id":"AD6u7AomJ3hC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"cN0NHmiDKcMI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
